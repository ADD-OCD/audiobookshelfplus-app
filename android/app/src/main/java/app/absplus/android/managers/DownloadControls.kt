/**
 * The user's download controls (Retry, Cancel, Clear) as pure decisions, applied by
 * [DownloadItemManager].
 *
 * Retry restarts every unfinished file from byte zero; files already finished in the destination
 * are kept. (Byte-range continuation only happens inside one service session, for the automatic
 * retries after a transfer error.) Cancel and Clear both remove the download: they stop its
 * transfers, drop it from the queue and delete the app's own partial (staging) files. Finished
 * files the download already placed in a device folder are kept there (a later download of the item
 * reuses them, and Rescan Folder can link them); finished files in internal app storage are
 * deleted, since nothing else can reach them. A file a saved local item uses, or one that existed
 * before this download, is never deleted.
